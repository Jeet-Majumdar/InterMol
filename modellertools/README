REQUIREMENTS

    *  MODELLER 9v1 ( http://salilab.org/modeller/ ) must be installed on your machine

INSTALLATION

    1) put the "modlib" directory (e.g. /Library/modeller-9v1/modlib/ ) in your PYTHONPATH.
       This directory contains the python modules needed by mmtools/modellertools

    2) copy the files

           mmtools/modellertools/lib/*.lib

       to modlib directory in the Modeller folder.  Just overwrite the files that are already there.

       As of this writing, these contain CHARMM-style residue parameters enabling MODELLER to 
       build models using the following (one-letter abbrev) non-canonical residues:

           dX	        D-amino acid version of residue X	
	   n		norleucine
