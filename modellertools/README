Setup:
- go to the Modeller website and download/install the software
- install the atom_range, inter-het-rsr, and top-commands patches from the modeller wiki
  - go to http://salilab.org/modeller/wiki/Patches
  - copy the patch files to the modeller9v1 directory
  - cd /Library/modeller-9v1
  - run "patch -p0 < filename" to install the patch
- copy the .lib files in the modellertools/lib directory into the modeller-9v1/modlib directory

Contents:
-  Model_PDB.py - contains code for homology modeling using Modeller
-  single_driver.py - code for testing Model_PDB on a single target/template specified as command line arguments
-  driver.py - code for testing all of the targets/tempates for the submicrosecond folders project
-  *.seq - one-letter sequences I used for testing
-  ????.pdb - PDB databank structures for all of our targets
-  ????_*.pdb - PDB outputs for each target
-  lib/top_heav.lib - new amino acid definitions for Modeller.  Should be put in your modeller-9v1/modlib directory.  L-amino acids are unchanged.  Added in D-amino acids with the same one letter codes as their L-counterparts, but in lower case.  Many improper constraints were removed to allow the D-form.  Only dALA and dPRO have been tested, others should be tested for proper chirality before use.  J and j and used to designate the L and D forms of norleucine.  PDB names are the same for both L and D forms.  For example, both dALA and lALA will appear as just ALA in the pdb file output by Modeller.
-  lib/restyp.lib - new amino acid list.  Should be put in your modeller-9v1/modlib directory as well.

Note: there are some patches on the modeller wiki site that may be good to install.
