*** INSTALLATION ***

1. Go to the Modeller website and download/install the software

2. Install the atom_range, inter-het-rsr, and top-commands patches from the modeller wiki
   (don't install the RNA patch as that will cause conflicts with d-amino acids, which are
   denoted by lowercase letters)

    - go to http://salilab.org/modeller/wiki/Patches
    - copy the patch files to the modeller9v1 directory
    - cd <modeller9v1-dir> (On the Mac, it will be /Library/modeller-9v1)
    - run "patch -p0 < filename" to install the patch
    - copy the .lib files in the modellertools/lib directory into the modeller-9v1/modlib directory

*** CONTENTS ***

Model_PDB.py 		- contains code for homology modeling using Modeller
single_driver.py 	- code for testing Model_PDB on a single target/template specified as
			  command line arguments
driver.py 		- code for testing all of the targets/tempates for the
			  submicrosecond folders project
*.seq 			- one-letter sequences I used for testing
????.pdb 		- PDB databank structures for all of our targets
????_*.pdb 		- PDB outputs for each target
lib/top_heav.lib 	- new amino acid definitions for Modeller.
	Should be put in your modeller-9v1/modlib directory.  L-amino acids are unchanged.
	Added in D-amino acids with the same one letter codes as their L-counterparts, but in
        lower case.  Many improper constraints were removed to allow the D-form.  Only dALA
	and dPRO have been tested, others should be tested for proper chirality before use.
	J and j and used to designate the L and D forms of norleucine.  PDB names are the same
	for both L and D forms.  For example, both dALA and lALA will appear as just ALA in
	the pdb file output by Modeller.
lib/restyp.lib 		- new amino acid list.  Should be put in your modeller-9v1/modlib directory as well.

Note: there are some patches on the modeller wiki site that may be good to install.
