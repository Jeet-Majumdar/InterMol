USAGE


There are three phases to setting up a relative FEP calculation with gromacs_dg and the provided scripts:

0. Parameterize the ligands with AnteChamber if you haven't done so already.

# Edit the 'PARAMETERS' section at the top of the file to set the path to parameterized ligands and the list of ligands to parameterize.
# Parameterize the ligands.
python parameterize-ligands.py

1. Look for pairwise common substructure overlap in your structures by using pairwise-common-substructures.py:

# Edit the 'PARAMETERS' section at the top of the file to set the path to parameterized ligands and the list of ligands to analyze.
# Search for pairwise common substructures.
python pairwise-common-substructures.py

2. Once you've picked a set of two or more ligands, look at the maximal common substructure.
The common substructure is defined as the maximal set of atoms that all match the same GAFF atom types and share the same GAFF bond types between them.
Note that the variable region SHOULD NOT include a ring breaking right now -- that would need to be handled by a special approach that allows all bonds but one to break
in the alchemical intermediates in a "soft-core" way using Morse potentials.

# Edit the 'PARAMETERS' section at the top of the file to specify which molecules you want to find a common substructure for.
# Find the common substructure and write out a mol2 file.
python extract-common-substructure.py

3. Once you're happy that this intermediate is reasonable, we need to set up FEP calculations for mutating each ligand to this intermediate both in complex and solution.

# Edit the 'PARAMETERS' section at the top of the file to specify which molecules you will use the common substructure for.
# Set up the free energy calculations.
python setup-replative-fep.py

4. To check the energies of the relative states

# Edit the 'PARAMETERS' section at the top of the file to specify which molecules you will check.
# Check the energies of the relative states.
python check-energies.py

Currently setup-relative-fep.py is set to prepare gromacs 4.0 mdp files but can be modified to create gromacs_dg mdp files in setup_solvent_simulation and setup_complex_simulation
