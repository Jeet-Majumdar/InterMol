DESCRIPTION

  This directory contains converters to transform systems between molecular mechanics packages.  Eventually, these will be replaced by a more full-featured Python system for representing the system in an internal format and reading/writing to formats various packages support, but for now, this is an ad hoc collection of useful utilities.

CONTENTS
