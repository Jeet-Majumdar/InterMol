NOTES on ST Reweighting scripts
Last updated: Dec 6, 2007

GetTempWeights.py - Vince's rewriting of Greg's Analysis.py, so it can read in 
	all the information it needs
	
Analysis.py - the most recent version of Greg's script for
	reweighting based on equalizing the acceptance ratios
	
RosettaAnalysis.py - OLD VERSION of Analysis.py, where Greg
    had the reweighting routine in a larger RosettaAnalysis class
