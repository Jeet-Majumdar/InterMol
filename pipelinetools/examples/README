Try:
>>> ./thread_multichain

This will thread a mutant sequence onto the three-chain PDB structure 1bb1.pdb

FILES

1bb1.pdb          -- a designed heterotrimeric coiled-coil protein with chains A, B and C from Tom Alber, et al.
1bb1.fasta.txt    -- the FASTA formated sequence for 1bb1 
1bb1.seq          -- a one-line single-letter sequence string, with chains separated by '/'
1bb1_mutant.seq   -- same, but with sequence with poly-alanine mutations for which we will build a homology model.
